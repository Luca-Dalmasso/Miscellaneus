# Stories and personas

### **John**
John is the store manager of a small shop. He works 5 days a week (from Tuesday to Saturday), from 8.00 Am to 6.00 Pm. 

##### Story 1
Every morning John opens the shop, and goes to his office. Since he needs to check the inventory and the catalogue, he logs into the application to keep track of the products of the store, so that he can contact suppliers for delivering orders.

##### Story 2
Once a week, on Friday afternoon, John needs to manage the store's accounting to keep track of the incoming, using the PC.

##### Story 3
On wednesday a young lady appeared in the shop. She, after asking to cashier that wants to be registered with a fidelity card, is sent to John's office. Here John inserts the customer data into the application and gives the card to the customer so she can proceed to purchase some goods.

##### Story 4
On saturday usually a new stock of products is delivered to John's shops. John before leaving the office would like to update the previous order in the inventory.

During the morning she follows university lectures, after that, in the afternoon, she works at the store form 2.00 Pm to 7.30 Pm. At the end of the working day, since usually is the last employee in the shop, she closes the store.

##### Story 1
Marta as always is sitting in her working place at POS, while reading the customer's products for the checkout. After some products have been read correctly, one is not read by the barcode because it's scratched. So Marta has to insert it in the cash register manually using the digits on the product, as fast as possible, because others customers are waiting in queue.

##### Story 2
Marta is interrupted by a customer while she was doing the checkout for him. The customer says that he forgotten the wallet at home, apologizing for that he helps Marta to put aside the products then he leaves the store. Marta after moving the products to put them back on the shelves, deletes the shopping list from the checkout and starts a new one for the next customers.

##### Story 3
A clumsy customer, after counting the change for a few moments, realize that doesn't have enough money to pay his bill in cash so he tells it to cashier Marta. She proceeds to change the payment method and enables the credit card terminal to complete the purchase. After successful payment the customer greets her and leaves the store.

##### Story 4
Marta, tired for the long day at university, makes a mistake and scans a product two times in a row. She realize it watching the display of the POS indicating the total quantity of the last scanned product. To solve the inconvinient the cashier has to remove from the checkout by deleting the duplicate so she can keep scanning the barcode of others products.

##### Story 5
Mark, a loyal customer and a close friend of Marta, shows up at the POS with few products to pay. Marta that knows well Mark ask him immediatly his fidelity card and scan it with the barcode reader.
